## 1. Install MPI

#### Linux User
I suggest using http://www.mpich.org/

You can download the [source code](http://www.mpich.org/static/downloads/3.2/mpich-3.2.tar.gz), or check the packages included in different distributions.


For example Ubuntu:

It is better to have build-essential installed in your OS before install mpich:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential
    $ sudo apt-get install mpich

Or you can use OpenMPI http://www.open-mpi.org/ by downloading the source code and compile it mannually.

#### OS X User

You do not need a Linux to run MPI program. OS X does support MPI programming
Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and use it for easy package management.

    $ brew install open-mpi

Please note that this will take a **super looooong time** to finish installation.

#### Windows User

I resist using Windows for HPC training. Though there are ways to do MPI coding on Windows. I strongly encourage you to install a Linux distribution and use MPI under linux environment

## 2. Learn MPI

> What is MPI

[MPI instroduction](http://mpitutorial.com/tutorials/mpi-introduction/)

[MPI Hello World](http://mpitutorial.com/tutorials/mpi-hello-world/)

        It is better if you write a Makefile and make it. Or you can just type:
        mpicc -std=c99 -o mpi_hello_world mpi_hello_world.c
        and run "$ ./mpi_hello_world" to see the results.

Wiki is sometimes to complicated for beginner, but it is worth reading.

Try and code it by your own.

[Lab Assignment 1 MPI APSP](https://www.dropbox.com/s/46kg4i6o83z2p6y/Lab%20Assignment%201%20MPI%20APSP.pdf?dl=0)

Code is given in the following link

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ml3e81jlh8rv94r/AACtpAtX5TtTt7G3oaZZke7Ga?dl=0

Replace the second timed function with your own MPI_floyd function, and test the speedup.

        Compile it by run
        $ mpicc -O3 -std=c99 -o APSPtest *.c
        And execute it by
        $ ./APSPtest
