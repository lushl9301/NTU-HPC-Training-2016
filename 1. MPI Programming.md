## 1. Install MPI

#### Linux User
I suggest using http://www.mpich.org/

You can download the [source code](http://www.mpich.org/static/downloads/3.2/mpich-3.2.tar.gz), or check the packages included in different distributions.


For example Ubuntu:

It is better to have build-essential installed in your OS before install mpich:

    $sudo apt-get install build-essential
    $sudo apt-get install mpich

Or you can use OpenMPI http://www.open-mpi.org/ by downloading the source code and compile it mannually.

#### OS X User

You do not need a Linux to run MPI program. OS X does support MPI programming
Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and use it for easy package management.

    $brew install open-mpi

Please note that this will take a **super looooong time** to finish installation.

#### Windows User

I resist using Windows for HPC training. Though there are ways to do MPI coding on Windows. I strongly encourage you to install a Linux distribution and use MPI under linux environment
